# Long read project

Our main goal is to develop a pipeline that allows comparison between long read sequences from any bacteria for strain identification using average nucleotide identity.

## Description

Currently, there is no definitive way to prove two strain are identical and no universally accepted average nucleotide identity (ANI) threshold for strain identification. We aim to generate a soft-coded pipeline utilizing python and R for strain comparison by statisitcally determining the likelihood that two strains are not dissimilar to one another. Through this we will produce a method for generating assembled long reads (that can be used independently) and create non-biased subsampling of long read sequences to reassemble for theoretical comparison.
